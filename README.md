## Frontend Engineer Take-home Challenge

Congratulations on getting through to the next interview stage. The next stage is to complete a short take-home challenge.

#### Task
Take the web application in this repository (by cloning it) and complete the following challenges:
1. Convert the cats page to use ReactJS (the index page should still use the EJS template); you will need to "hybrid" the codebase to use both React & EJS. 
2. Create a fullscreen ReactJS page (where the height is exactly 100% of the screen, there is no scrolling), following the wireframe below: ![Wireframe](https://i.imgur.com/hSDiZ5E.png) The page can be basic, you shouldn't spend any longer than 45 minutes on this task.

You have a week from when you get access to this repository to complete the tasks. Once you've completed this challenge, please push your code to your own private repo and share it with ben@tryhackme.com and ashu@tryhackme.com
